C language modem driver with AT command layout

    (1) Code work well on FreeRTOS.

    (2) AT command come from ublox. 

    (3) Error code using positive value is other guy's idea and feel free make fun of it.

    (4) AT layout choose loop mode and synchronize with UART is decide by UART driver which out of my hand.
